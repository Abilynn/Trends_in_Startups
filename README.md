# Trends_in_Startups
## Business Task
The task at hand involves conducting a comprehensive analysis of the rising trends within the startup world using a dataset of significant industry players. The dataset, titled "startupstrends" comprises a table containing vital information about prominent companies.

The goal of this analysis is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset by employing SQL queries with aggregate functions. The queries will be designed to uncover trends related to industries, funding patterns, anad geographical distribution within the startup companies. These insights will offer valuable information about the current dynamics of the startup landscape.

I would be answering the following business questions to gain insights:
1. Viewing the startups table: What are the column names?
2. Calculate the total number of companies in the table.
3. We want to know the total value of all companies in this table.
4. What is the highest amount raised by a startup?
5. The maximum amount of money raised, during ‘Seed’ stage.
6. In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?
7. Return the average valuation.
8. Return the average valuation, in each category.
9. Return the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it.
10. Filter the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them. What are the most competitive markets?
11. What is the average size of a startup in each location?
12. What is the average size of a startup in each location, with average sizes above 500?
